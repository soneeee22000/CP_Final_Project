Raman spectroscopy

Spectroscopic technique
Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed.

In this project, given a dataset and a paper! we try to use different machine learning models like GRU ( Gated...) to compare the performance and settle on the best one! which was mine! giving up almost perfect performance score! But, it's highly due to our relatively low train samples split! GRU models basically are good at learning from sequence data like Raman Spectroscopy!
